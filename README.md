🛡️ Sovereign Patient Wearable System

A modular, local-first wearable protocol for hospitals—designed to enhance patient safety, streamline staff workflows, and ritualize well-being tracking. This system transforms a low-cost smartwatch into a sovereign companion, empowering both patients and caregivers through real-time data, consent-driven rituals, and operational visibility.

📦 Overview

This system provides:

- GPS-based safety tracking for inpatient mobility
- Appointment and medication timing logs for workflow optimization
- Mood and well-being check-ins for holistic care
- Local-first architecture with encrypted data and modular config files
- Plug-and-play setup for rapid deployment and minimal training

- Wearable Device: BLE-enabled smartwatch with GPS, haptic feedback, and basic UI
- Edge Gateway: Tablet or Raspberry Pi hub in patient room or nurse station
- Encrypted Data Store: Local-only unless patient opts into cloud sync
- Dashboard: Staff-facing interface for alerts, logs, and analytics
- Interaction Layer: Patient check-ins, alerts, and confirmations

---

🔐 Consent & Caveats

Upon admission, patients receive a Consent Scroll outlining:

- 📍 Location Sharing: GPS data used solely for safety and emergency response
- 🛠️ Device Responsibility: Patients liable for loss or damage; device remains hospital property
- 🧙 Sovereign Data Rights: Patients may request encrypted data export upon discharge

⚙️ Setup Ritual

1. Plug In: Connect wearable to edge device via USB/BLE
2. Drag & Drop Config: Staff loads patient profile JSON into device
3. Auto-Sync: Device configures geofence, alerts, and check-in schedule
4. Test Ritual: Patient walks to geofence edge; alert confirms setup
5. Activation Scroll: Patient receives printed or digital guide to device features
